            Start your Reiki session with a chakra scan to help determine
            unbalanced areas within your physical being. Then relax as
            <b> Christina</b>, with or without touch, gently manipulates your
            energy to promote healing, relaxation, and wellbeing. After your
            Energy Healing, you will do another scan. You will then be able to
            compare your scans and see the benefits of your session.

            The universe speaks to all. Too bad these messages are not always
            clear. Maybe, a reoccurring dream has you frustrated, another
            message that seems to be in a cryptic language. Insight through
            Tarot, Oracle, palm reading or dream interpretation can help resolve
            those questions you have about certain aspects of your life. Your
            session with
            <b> Stephanie</b> is kept completely confidential, and you will be
            enlightened to what your universe wants you to know.
